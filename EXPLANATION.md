The attempt here was to put all validation rules, as well as the documentation, into the JSON Schema (`config.schema.json`), and to use [tools](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html) like [JSON Schema for Humans](https://github.com/coveooss/json-schema-for-humans) to generate documentation (and put it to a GitHub Pages web page in the repository. This would be done automatically via a GitHub Actions workflow) and use [Ajv](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv) to validate a config file.

However, decided that this is way too complex and to keep it simple. Hence, will pass everything (including the GitHub access token and GitHub organization name) from the command line.
